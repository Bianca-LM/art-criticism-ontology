# OM&TA (Ontology of Materials & Techniques in Art)

The OM&TA ontology has the main goal of describing the relation between material and techniques in art. 

In order to be representative of the domain and since each artwork is a complex object the ontology tries to inglobe and represent every element that can have its specific technique or material, e.g inscriptions or signatures. 

The website of the project is accessible at this [link](https://bianca-lm.github.io/art-criticism-ontology/).

If you want to take a look directly at the ontolgy, see the [documentation](http://150.146.207.114/lode/extract?owlapi=true&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bianca-LM/art-criticism-ontology/main/OMETA.owl)
