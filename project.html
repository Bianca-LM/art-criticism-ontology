			<!-- DA METTERE COME COMPARISON BETWEEN ONTOLOGIES NELLA DOCUMENTAZIONE 
				<h2>Previous works</h2>
			<p>Different ontologies have already tried to describe artworks in all their aspects, e.g. CIDOC-CRM. In particular <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco">ArCo</a> Ontology has already a module for denotative description which describes materials and techniques performed on the artworks.
			The OM&TA ontology does not overlap with the previous two since it is domain-specific and, on the counterpart, needs to be extended through other ontologies as ArCo in order to describe all the other aspects and definitions of the artwork.
			As we will see in the documentation, what changes with the OM&TA ontology is the relation between artwork, technique and material. 
			</p>

            <h2>Methodology: Ontology requirements specification document (ORSD)</h2>
            <p>The main functionalities of the ontology have been defined following the guidelines for ontology requirements specification document (ORSD) proposed in the paper "How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document" by Suárez-Figueroa et al.</p>
			<p>The data taken under consideration have been extracted from some of the artworks described in the following catalogues of the MET museums:
				<ul>	
					<li><a class="link" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Italian_Paintings_A_Catalogue_of_the_Collection_of_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Vol_2_Venetian_School">"Italian paintings. Vol. 2, Venetian School"</a> by Federico Zeri;</li>
				</ul> 
			</p>
			<p>By following the template proposed by the authors, we have identified the basic requirements to develop this ontology as exposed in the following table.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Purpose:</b> represent the relationship between materials and techniques in art;</li>
                <li><b>Scope:</b> the ontology will define artworks at the level of denotative description taking under consideration all the elements that can be related to a material or technique.</li>
                <li><b>Implementation Language:</b> it is developed through <a class="link" href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a> which supports OWL and RDF.</li>
                <li><b>Intended End-Users:</b> public or private institutions which need to make available information about artworks in Linked Open Data (LOD).</li>
                <li><b>Intended Uses:</b> domain experts which wants to search for specific associations of materials and techniques; privates who wants to explore materials and techniques in arts.</li>
                <li><b>Ontology Requirements:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Non-Functional Requirements:</b> the ontology must be compliant with international standards.</li>
                        <li><b>Functional Requirements:</b> Competency Questions (CQs) which in the end the user will be able to answer through the queries performed on a SPARQL endpoint.</br>
                            In this first draft the CQs will be written in natural language, since they are real questions between human beign, not yet formalized to be understandable by a machine. The expected answers are given according to the data contained in the Zeri catalogue (see above)</b>

				<h2>Modelling</h2>
				<p>Starting from the definition of material and technique given by Sciolla, we started modelling our ontology starting from the descriptions of the paintings available in the volumes "Italian Paintings: A Catalogue of the Collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art" by Federico Zeri. <br>
				All the descriptionsin the catalogues have more or less the same structure from which the main entities for the description of materials and techniques can be extracted. 
				First we started by analysing how materials and techniques where expressed and which were their relationships. As it can be seen from the two examples, immediately it turns out that the material and the support can coincide or they can be different, i.e. a material mounted on a support.
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
						<img src="images/Modelling1.png" alt="Description of 'Three Saints: Roch, Anthony Abbot, and Lucy' by Giovanni Battista Cima"/>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
						<img src="images/Modelling2.png" alt="Decription of a Landscape by Francesco Guardi"/>
					</div>
				</div>
				This brought to the definition of the first classes and relationships which are the core of the ontology.<br>
				The central realtions from which the ontology has been shaped is the one between technique and material which is defined through the concept that an <b>artwork</b> is realized <span class="underlined">by means of</span> a <b>technique</b> which is <span class="underlined">performed on</span> a <b>material</b>.

            <h2>The conceptual model</h2>
			<p>From the chapters <i>I materiali</i> and <i>Le tecniche</i> it is possible to extract the first entities and relations that could formalize the concepts of materials and techniques in the artworks.</p>
			<p>The first step was the creation of a conceptual model which tries to define the main elements and how they are related. Since materials and techniques are still at the level of denotative description, they are related to all the elements, as "Signature" or "Frame", which sometimes are added through a different technique or material from the one largely used for the artwork.</p>
