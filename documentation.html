					<!-- DA METTERE COME COMPARISON BETWEEN ONTOLOGIES NELLA DOCUMENTAZIONE 
						<h2>Previous works</h2>
					<p>Different ontologies have already tried to describe artworks in all their aspects, e.g. CIDOC-CRM. In particular <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco">ArCo</a> Ontology has already a module for denotative description which describes materials and techniques performed on the artworks.
					The OM&TA ontology does not overlap with the previous two since it is domain-specific and, on the counterpart, needs to be extended through other ontologies as ArCo in order to describe all the other aspects and definitions of the artwork.
					As we will see in the documentation, what changes with the OM&TA ontology is the relation between artwork, technique and material. 
					</p>
					-->
		
		
					<h2>Methodology: Ontology requirements specification document (ORSD)</h2>
					<p>The main functionalities of the ontology have been defined following the guidelines for ontology requirements specification document (ORSD) proposed in the paper "How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document" by Suárez-Figueroa et al.</p>
					<p>The data taken under consideration have been extracted from some of the artworks described in the following catalogues of the MET museums:
						<ul>	
							<li><a class="link" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Italian_Paintings_A_Catalogue_of_the_Collection_of_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Vol_2_Venetian_School">"Italian paintings. Vol. 2, Venetian School"</a> by Federico Zeri;</li>
						</ul> 
					</p>
					<p>By following the template proposed by the authors, we have identified the basic requirements to develop this ontology as exposed in the following table.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Purpose:</b> represent the relationship between materials and techniques in art;</li>
						<li><b>Scope:</b> the ontology will define artworks at the level of denotative description taking under consideration all the elements that can be related to a material or technique.</li>
						<li><b>Implementation Language:</b> it is developed through <a class="link" href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a> which supports OWL and RDF.</li>
						<li><b>Intended End-Users:</b> public or private institutions which need to make available information about artworks in Linked Open Data (LOD).</li>
						<li><b>Intended Uses:</b> domain experts which wants to search for specific associations of materials and techniques; privates who wants to explore materials and techniques in arts.</li>
						<li><b>Ontology Requirements:</b>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Non-Functional Requirements:</b> the ontology must be compliant with international standards.</li>
								<li><b>Functional Requirements:</b> Competency Questions (CQs) which in the end the user will be able to answer through the queries performed on a SPARQL endpoint.</br>
									In this first draft the CQs will be written in natural language, since they are real questions between human beign, not yet formalized to be understandable by a machine. The expected answers are given according to the data contained in the Zeri catalogue (see above)</b>

						<h2>Modelling</h2>
						<p>Starting from the definition of material and technique given by Sciolla, we started modelling our ontology starting from the descriptions of the paintings available in the volumes "Italian Paintings: A Catalogue of the Collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art" by Federico Zeri. <br>
						All the descriptionsin the catalogues have more or less the same structure from which the main entities for the description of materials and techniques can be extracted. 
						First we started by analysing how materials and techniques where expressed and which were their relationships. As it can be seen from the two examples, immediately it turns out that the material and the support can coincide or they can be different, i.e. a material mounted on a support.
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
								<img src="images/Modelling1.png" alt="Description of 'Three Saints: Roch, Anthony Abbot, and Lucy' by Giovanni Battista Cima"/>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
								<img src="images/Modelling2.png" alt="Decription of a Landscape by Francesco Guardi"/>
							</div>
						</div>
						This brought to the definition of the first classes and relationships which are the core of the ontology.<br>
						The central realtions from which the ontology has been shaped is the one between technique and material which is defined through the concept that an <b>artwork</b> is realized <span class="underlined">by means of</span> a <b>technique</b> which is <span class="underlined">performed on</span> a <b>material</b>.

					<h1>Ontology Design and Implementation</h1>
			<h2>The conceptual model</h2>
			<p>From the chapters <i>I materiali</i> and <i>Le tecniche</i> it is possible to extract the first entities and relations that could formalize the concepts of materials and techniques in the artworks.</p>
			<p>The first step was the creation of a <b>conceptual model</b> which tries to define the main elements and how they are related. Since materials and techniques are still at the level of denotative description, they are related to all the elements, as "Signature" or "Frame", which sometimes are added through a different technique or material from the one largely used for the artwork.</p>
			<figure>
	    		<img src="images\TMmAP.jpg" alt="Conceptual model">
	    	</figure>
			<h2>The Ontology</h2>
			<p>Starting from the very first theorization, then we proceded by the implementation of the actual ontology.</p>
			<figure>
	    		<img src="images\Graffoo.png" alt="E/R diagram" id="ER">

			<hr>
			<p>The ontology was designed on <a class="link" href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a>, an open-source ontology editor. 
			Classes, object properties, data properties, named individuals, annotation properties, general axioms and namespace declarations are described in the documentation.</p>

			<h1>Data Extraction and Dataset</h1>
			<h2>Automatic Extraction of Materials and Techniques</h2>
			<p>Starting from <a class="link" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Italian_Paintings_A_Catalogue_of_the_Collection_of_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Vol_2_Venetian_School">Zeri's catalogue</a> of paintins, an automatic extraction was performed on the text in order to define the main elements: title, author, material and technique.</p>
			<p>The steps to extract the data can be summed as follows:
				<ol>
					<li>Cleaning and text preparation: provide a clean text, in a machine-readable format</li>
					<li>Paragraphs and section: automatic division of the text into titles and paragraphs. In this way it will be easier to define where to search information. In this case, the division has been performed through Regular Expression (RE) but other methods can be used according to the internal organization of the text (for example, nlp tools as spacy provide a paragraph division).</li>
					<li>Definition of titles and authors: after the identification of titles, through Names Entity Recognition it was possible to extract names of authors, while name of artworks where extracted through RE.</li>
					<li>Extraction of materials and techniques: in order to perform an automatic extraction we used as reference the two skos vocabularies: 
						<ul>
							<li><a class="link" href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview/vocabularies/opere_e_oggetti_d_arte_materia/def/.html">Thesaurus per la definizione della materia per le opere e gli oggetti d'arte</a></li>
							<li><a class="link" href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview/vocabularies/opere_e_oggetti_d_arte_tecnica/def/.html">Thesaurus per la definizione della tecnica per le opere e gli oggetti d'arte</a></li>
						</ul>
					Since both of them where in italian, it was necessary to translate them in English. This operation was automated too through the python library <a class="link" href="https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/">deep translator</a>
					</li>
					<li>Cleaning and perfectioning: after the automatic extraction, some operations where needed in order to have reliable results: 
						<ul>
							<li>Due to the automatic translation, some words weren't translated propertly: for example, "blue" was inserted to the list as a translation for some blue stones. This cleaning step is an exception, since it would not be necessary by using the original Italian vocabulary on Italian texts, or by providing an English version of that one.</li>
							<li>Since the vocabulary does not provide an organization of materials according to the kind of art, some "outsider" materials ended up in the final list. For example, "marble" is not a material appropriate for paintings, but some paintings represents "marble objects". An easy solution and a possible further development of this ontology would be to group materials from the vocabulary under their proper art category, like 'Painting_Material' and 'Sculpture_Material'.<br/>
							This is true also for "stucco" which has been correctly detected in the text, but should go under the "Decorative_Techniques" and not the main one.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bianca-LM/art-criticism-ontology/main/dataExtraction.py"><button>Final Python code available here</button></a>
			</p>
			<p>In order to test as much classes as possible from the ontology, for 35 artworks additional information (as signature, inscription, support etc.) where manually extracted from the reference text and added to the dataset.
			</p>
			<h2>Dataset and Knowlede Graph</h2>
			<p>The intersection of the automatic and the manually extracted data has been used in order to populate the knowledge graph (python code available <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Bianca-LM/art-criticism-ontology/blob/main/KnowledgeGraph.py">here</a>)
